# m0ntan1 Vibe Academy

**Free. Self-paced. Built for West Virginia.**

Montani Vibe Academy is a free 12-week curriculum that teaches anyone in West Virginia how to build websites, apps, and AI-powered tools — no experience required, no tuition, no gatekeeping.

Whether you're in Charleston, Morgantown, Huntington, or Mingo County, the same AI tools used by Silicon Valley startups are available right now on any laptop. This is how we close the gap. This is how we punch above our weight class.

## What You'll Build

Over 12 weeks across 3 phases, students go from zero to shipping real products:

- **Phase 1 — Foundations** (Weeks 1–4): How the web works, CSS, JavaScript, and AI as your coding co-pilot
- **Phase 2 — Build Things** (Weeks 5–8): Real websites, landing pages, live APIs, and AI-powered apps
- **Phase 3 — Ship It** (Weeks 9–12): No-code + code hybrid workflows, automations, and a capstone product

## Who This Is For

Anyone. Seriously. If you've never written a line of code, you're exactly who this was built for. If you're a developer who wants to level up with AI tools, there's something here for you too.

## Free Forever

This curriculum is and will always be free for West Virginians. It's a resource, not a product.
